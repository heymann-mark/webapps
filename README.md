This program is a simple program using html, CSS, and PHP.
I connect to a database on my local machine using xampp.
I use the design pattern Model View Controller.
I used a PDO to connect to the database, and used
prepared statements to prevent sql injection.

The program initiates a session but doesn't use any session variables.

It's a simple app that has two parts, customer and admin.
The customer can order a snadwich, view it's status, and mark it as delivered.
The admin can add menu items, mark sandwiches as ready.
